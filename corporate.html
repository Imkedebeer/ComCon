                <li>The test&rsquo;s <strong>participants</strong> (number, match with target audience, etc.)</li>
					<p class="fst-italic">The method was <strong>in-person usability testing</strong>. They used one of our laptops. We were standing next to them in case they needed guidance. We tested our website with <strong>3 participants</strong> Mauro, Jay Jay and Sanne. They are students at Breda University of Applied Sciences as it would be complicated to test it with our target group. We informed them on our target audience and that they should keep in mind that the website is also meant for them as it is a crowdfunding website.</p>
                <li>The test&rsquo;s <strong>setting</strong> (which material is used, is it done remotely, on campus, at home, etc.)</li>
				    <p class="fst-italic">The test is done <strong>remotely on campus</strong>. The participants are sitting in front of the laptop. During the testing, <strong>only a laptop is used</strong>. We are filming the participants during the test and giving instructions on where we want them to go.</p>
                <li>The test&rsquo;s <strong>protocol</strong> (what instructions are given, how it is recorded, etc.)</li>
				    <p class="fst-italic">The testing will be recorded on video and the users will sign a consent form. Before we start, we tell them to not go on the corporate page and explain they are portraying 65+. Then, we ask them a set of <strong>Questions</strong>:</p>
		  <ol class="py-3">
            <li>Can you talk us through the process of reading about the team of ComCon?</li>
            <li>Can you go to our Facebook page?</li>

                <li>Positive and negative aspects of the UI/UX that have been identified, ranked by importance.</li>
				  <p class="fst-italic">During the user testing, it was mentioned a couple of times that the <strong>fonts could be made a bit bigger</strong> as elderly people aren’t able to read everything. It was also mentioned that the menu right above the page should be on the left. This is because you read from right to left naturally. However, she also mentioned that it was easy to find. Furthermore, they said that it was <strong>clear what our brand was about</strong> and how to find our socials and information about our team, the <strong>only link not working was the email</strong>.</p>
                <li>Improvements that have been implemented on the final website (or that would be implemented if doing so would be too complex)</li>
				  <p class="fst-italic">An improvement that was implemented is <strong>making the values more clear</strong> on the home page. We fixed the <strong>link to the email</strong>. Because when you click on the link, it didn't work. The <strong>fonts</strong> could be bigger so that it is more readable for elderly people.</p>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Our brand is all about helping elderly people who live alone with technology. Helping them understand the services on the internet. In-class and at home.</p>
<p class="fw-bold text-decoration-underline">Communication message and objectives</p>
<p><strong>Communication message:</strong> “We want to create a brand that understands the situation elderly people who live alone are in. Not victimize them but understand what they want and need.”</p>
<p><strong>Reach objective:</strong> Social media – minimum of 50 followers on Facebook and LinkedIn. Reach and engagement of 15 per post.</p>
<p><strong>Affective objective:</strong> Seen, Understood, Respected, and Connected.</p>
<p><strong>Response objective:</strong> Trust us.</p>
<p>We want to achieve a connection between elderly people and offer them a good time during the activities.</p>
<p class="text-decoration-underline"><strong>Target audience</strong></p>
<p>Our target audience is elderly people above 65. According to the CBS (Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics), still around 73% of people aged 65+ use the internet and some social media: Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, LinkedIn. Facebook is the most popular social media platform among 70+ year-olds in the Netherlands, with 69% of this age group using the platform. LinkedIn is also used by our target audience in the Netherlands. According to the CBS report, 16% of this age group uses the professional networking platform (CBS, 2020).</p>
<p>Elderly people tend to portray loyalty once they like a brand, make it personal by addressing them directly with possible discounts, and emphasize our brand's usefulness as that is a way to charm the elderly. The rest of the percentage doesn’t even use the internet, so another way to get to them, is through old habits. Plus, seniors often trust print newspapers as a credible source of information rather than newer digital marketing methods. ‘Older users primarily use social media for diversion – passing the time when bored – and entertainment’ (University of Alabama Huntsville, 2021). They still prefer face-to-face interactions for relationship maintenance, Dr. Sheldon says. Through Facebook and LinkedIn, we want to communicate our message; “Create a brand that understands the situation elderly people who live alone are in. Not victimize them but understand what they want and need.”</p>
<p>Based on analysis of the previous research on the elderly's behaviour on socials the following has been noticed: The elderly like their daily routines. They usually wake up and get ready, upon which they will check their socials and emails going on the computer/phone after breakfast for example. Also, most of them only use their house connection, meaning as soon as they leave, they won't be active. In this case, morning (9 am) to lunchtime is best to post to target them.</p>
<p><strong>To add, general times to post with the most active users throughout the day/week on Facebook:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>You will get the most consistent engagement on weekdays from 9 am–3 pm. The worst day is Sunday, which sees the least amount of engagement. You will find the lowest engagement during early mornings and evenings before 7 am and after 5 pm each day (Geyser, 2023).</li>
  <li>Overall best time to post on Facebook based on an analysis of 30,000 social media posts, Hootsuite found out that the best overall time to post on Facebook is between 8 a.m. and noon on Tuesdays and Thursdays (Christina Newberry, 2023).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Based on the previous information we will post on:</strong></p>
			<h6 class="text-decoration-underline">Tech Tuesday</h6>
<p>Tuesday between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m.</p>
<p>Share helpful tips and advice on using technology that is simple and easy to understand, to help older people stay connected with their loved ones or do simple tasks online as a lot is shifting to online.</p>
<h6 class="text-decoration-underline">Fun Friday</h6>
<p>Friday between 10 a.m. and 12 a.m.</p>
<p>Share fun and light-hearted content such as memes, jokes, or quizzes that older people can engage with and share with their friends and family, helping to strengthen connections and build community.</p>
<p class="text-decoration-underline"><strong>Media Tactics</strong></p>
<p>Our target audience uses Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube, and LinkedIn. For our brand, we are going to use only Facebook and LinkedIn. Using these social media platforms is the most effective way to promote our brand. Facebook has communities we could join and send messages in, to lead them to our page. It is also possible to create posts and stories. LinkedIn, we were surprised to see that elderly people use it. Although, you cannot find exactly how and why they use LinkedIn, probably just because the elderly starts working for longer nowadays and try to adapt to the new ways.</p>
<p>According to the Dutch Social Media Monitor 2021 by Newcom Research and Consultancy, 81% of people aged 65 to 79 who use Facebook in the Netherlands give likes to posts, while 69% share posts and 62% comment on posts. The figures are slightly lower for people aged 80 and older, with 73% giving likes, 55% sharing posts, and 45% commenting on posts.</p>
<p>A 2019 article by Marketingfacts, a Dutch website that provides marketing news and insights, reported that seniors in the Netherlands are more likely to share content on Facebook than other age groups. The article cited data from Newcom Research and Consultancy, which found that 43% of Facebook users aged 65 and older in the Netherlands share content on the platform, compared to 34% of users aged 40 to 64 and 24% of users aged 18 to 39.</p>
<p>An article on SeniorWeb reported that elderly people in the Netherlands are more likely to engage with positive posts on Facebook. The article cited research from the University of Pennsylvania, which found that older adults are more likely to share content that is uplifting and positive.</p>

          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>During the feedback session, it was mentioned that our content was really good. It deserved more recognition. We had good content, with a detailed explanation of certain content that we are also using for our product. For example the step for step explanation about taxes and Microsoft Teams. Unfortunately, we didn’t get a lot of reach, engagement, and followers. We didn’t reach our objective. We did join communities on Facebook, however, that is not enough. We should’ve posted in the communities to lead people to our page. We are aware that Facebook and LinkedIn are not the easiest social media platforms to gain followers. However, Instagram wasn’t an option as it couldn’t reach our target audience</p>
          <p>As you can see in our Professionalism, time management was difficult. We posted late a lot of times and even a day later once. It would be easier to be able to plan a post, however, we don’t know If this was even possible. Next time, we should set a reminder for example. &nbsp;</p>
<h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>As for the future, we would post more technical tips. For example, how to sign up for an event or appointment online, or how to search for information in the most effective way.  We would introduce our first workshop and from there one we would share the content of our workshops. When we look at our learning points, we should post our content in the communities on Facebook to gain more followers and reach our objectives.</p>
